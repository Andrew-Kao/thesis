\begin{abstract}
%\noindent When deciding whether to publicly express their views and attitudes, individuals may take into account their perception of the social acceptability of these views, which in turn depends on (and affects) their perception of the popularity of the view. Even if a substantial fraction of society \emph{privately} holds a specific view, that view might end up stigmatized and publicly withheld in equilibrium if individuals have initial beliefs that the view is stigmatized. 

%%%% FOR SUBMISSION FORM:
%\noindent Social norms, usually persistent, can unravel quickly when new public information arrives, such as surprising election outcomes. In our model of strategic communication, senders state their opinion but they can lie to pander to the popular view; receivers thus make less inference about such senders. We test the model's predictions with two experiments. On the sender's side, we show that Trump's rise in popularity and eventual victory increased individuals' willingness to publicly express xenophobic views. On the receiver's side, we show that individuals are judged less if they expressed a xenophobic view in an environment where the view is popular.

\section{Introduction}

Mass media lets us know what the outside world thinks, and this shapes the way that we think.

- Media plays a large role in shaping our lives

- Latino consumption of broadcast TV remains relevant

- Relevant subquestion: how identity is affected

Three domains

- Education

- Firms

- Politics


The high level research question is to look at the effect of reinforcing identity within Hispanic populations on their schooling outcomes. Specifically, I'll be using the influence of Spanish language television as the channel by which identity is reinforced, and look at how it affects everything from graduation rates to disciplinary action taken to math abilities and English proficiency for Hispanic students in public schools. In short, if I have access to more programming from my home country, does this make me less engaged in school (perhaps because there are more distractions or because it socially ostracizes me etc.), or does this make me perform better (perhaps because l have more role models or because I have something to talk with peers about in school, and hence motivation to attend/perform)?

There's good reason to believe that identity, as reinforced through mass media, has a large effect on the lives people lead. @CITE  Oberholzer-Gee, Waldfogel (AER 2009) demonstrate that the presence of Spanish language local news increases Hispanic voter turnout, while @CITE Yanigazawa-Drott (QJE 2014) shows that radio broadcasts in Rwanda contributed to the violence and genocide that took place in the 90s. It would be reasonable to think then, that there could be a meaningful effect of Spanish language TV on education.

\section{Data}\label{secdata}


\subsection{Broadcast TV}

To build the coverage contours of SLTV stations in the US, we collected a list of the callsigns for all SLTV stations via the TMS (a large provider of data on TV, movies, and other media) API.\footnote{ A TV station is defined to be SLTV if at least one of the primary broadcasts languages are Spanish.} These callsigns are then matched against data from the FCC's OET-69 Bulletin and the FCC's CDBS Database to directly obtain the relevant coverage contour boundaries as prescribed and regulated by the FCC. \footnote{ 2015 coverage contour data is used due to the 'FCC Spectrum Repack' that began in 2018, which relocates a number of signals, affecting the reception and coverage for a substantial number of stations.} %@CITE https://www.commlawblog.com/2018/03/articles/fcc/fcc-updates-dtv-reception-map/

For data that take the form of spatial points (such as the location of a school), determining whether the datapoint falls within the coverage boundary (and receives SLTV coverage) and its distance to the boundary is a straightforward process. For data that cover a wider area (such as a county), in the standard specification, the area is said to fall within the coverage boundary if at least some portion of it does, and the distance from the area to the boundary is taken as the minimum distance from the boundary to the area. In locations covered by multiple SLTV stations, the distance to the boundary is taken as the distance to the closest boundary.
% TODO: robustness; experiment with this for county controls data! calculate area... maybe also for campaigns

\subsection{Controls and Other Non-Outcome Data}
Controls at the county level are sourced from IPUMS, and consist of basic relevant demographic information: population, income, percent of county that is Hispanic etc.

Data on migration comes from the 2011-2015 ACS, which reports the number of people moving from each origin county to destination county (aggregated over the years).\footnote{ Historically, approximately 15\% of the ACS migration data has been allocated (imputed based on salient characteristics). @CITTE(https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample-size-and-data-quality/) } This sample also contains migration flows by Hispanic origin, allowing us to determine whether they move based on geographic boundaries.
% TODO: propagate errors based on the margin of error

Finally, data for specific outcomes are discussed under their relevant section.



\section{Empirical Strategy}\label{secrd}

To isolate the causal effect of Spanish language television, I adopt the technique used in \cite{velez_tuning_2019}  and generalize it from three counties to the entirety of the US. Newman and Velez exploit a FCC (Federal Communications Commission) regulation which determines the distance from a TV station in which the station's broadcast signal is protected from interference. 

(An example of a contour boundary can be seen in Figure \ref{contourexamplefig})

The instrument consists of two variables interacted: First, a dummy whether the outcome data falls 

This creates a natural regression discontinuity, where the decaying strength of a signal over distance is combined with this cutoff in broadcast protection to create a split among people just inside and outside these coverage 'contours' that are presumably comparable save for their access to broadcast TV. 

In the case of Spanish language TV in particular, this should allow me to examine its causal effect on Hispanic populations for spatially located outcomes, such as public schooling results. It's worth noting that these contours are purely determined by an algorithm that looks at things like local elevation and antennae strength, so that the cutoffs are located in more or less random locations, and that coverage is large enough that these contours tend to cut across towns and suburbs, rather than cities. Finally, regressions using US census data indicate that Hispanic people do not migrate across counties in response to these contours.

A standard regression thus looks like restricting the universe of schools to only those within a small radius of the contour boundary, where the key independent variable of interest is an indicator for the school being inside or outside the boundary.

\subsection{Main Specification}

A standard regression thus looks like restricting the universe of schools to only those within a small radius of the contour boundary, where the key independent variable of interest is an indicator for the school being inside or outside the boundary, interacted with the distance to the boundary:
\[ Y_i^{j,k} = \beta_0 + \beta \mathbb{I}[InsideContour_i] \times Distance_i + \gamma X_i + \delta Z^j + \epsilon_i^k \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \epsilon \stackrel{iid}{\sim}   N(0,\sigma_i^{k^2})\]

where $Y_i$ is an outcome for school $i$ in county $j$ and school district $k$, $X$ is a vector of school-level controls, and $Z$ is a vector of county-level controls. Errors are often clustered by school district, meaning that $Corr(\sigma_i^k, \sigma_{i'}^k) \neq 0$ is permissible.

By limiting the analysis to a small distance from the contour boundary ($100$ KM/63 miles by default), we also minimize the potential concerns of omitted variable bias etc., as these schools must now be at least fairly close to one another, meaning that they probably share many overarching characteristics.


\subsection{Migration}

\section{Public Schools}\label{secschool}
\subsection{Data}

The data on public schools comes from the US government's CRDC (Civil Rights Data Collection) dataset. It's a very large dataset with a ton of outcome/control variables, but importantly, it breaks down all major variables of interest by ethnicity. These variables includes graduation rates, chronic absenteeism, suspensions, expulsions, arrests, bullying, AP test results, English proficiency, math class performances, gifted program enrolment etc., so I can look at effects on both the top and bottom end of the distribution, and examine potential mechanisms driving outcomes. These are all at the school level, and so I can run this through ArcGIS to get physical locations of these schools as well.

\subsection{Discussion}



%We implemented the first experiment respectively in the two weeks before and in the week after the 2016 presidential election. The timing of the experiment allowed us to exploit the uniqueness of the situation and study the process of information aggregation as it was unfolding. We conducted both waves with workers from the online platform MTurk. A number of recent papers in economics have used the same platform to conduct surveys or experiments (e.g., \citealp{kuziemco_et_al_2015_elastic}). The platform draws workers from very diverse backgrounds, though it is not representative of the U.S. population as a whole.


%Appendix Table \ref{balance1} provides evidence that individual characteristics are balanced across all four pre-election experimental conditions, confirming that the randomization was successful. The first four bars of Figure \ref{mainexperiment1fig} display our main findings from the pre-election experiment. In the control condition before the election, we observe a large and statistically significant wedge between donation rates in private and in public: a drop from 54\% in private to 34\% in public (the p-value of a \emph{t} test of equality is 0.002). Among individuals in the information condition, we observe no difference in private and public donation rates, which are 47\% and 46\%, respectively (\emph{p}-value=0.839). Moreover, we find no significant difference in private donation rates between the information and control conditions (\emph{p}-value=0.280), suggesting that the information is not increasing privately-held xenophobia. The increase in public donation rates between the two conditions is statistically significant (\emph{p}-value=0.089), as is the difference in differences between donation rates in private across conditions and donation rates in public across conditions (\emph{p}-value=0.050). These results indicate that the information provided causally increased the social acceptability of the action to the point of eliminating the original social stigma associated with it.\footnote{Apart from social stigma, another possible reason %An additional explanation to social stigma 
%for the lower donation rates in the public condition with respect to the private condition is that participants might want to avoid talking with the surveyor because of the extra effort and time this requires (independently of the topic of the conversation), and they might expect the likelihood of having to talk to be higher in case they decide to make the donation. However, this mechanism should operate identically both in the control and in the treatment conditions, thus not affecting our identification of the reduction in social stigma.} The first two columns of Table \ref{mainexperiment1tab} display the difference in differences results in regression format and show that our results are unchanged when individual covariates are included. The table also displays \emph{p}-values from permutation tests, showing that our findings are robust to that inference method.
