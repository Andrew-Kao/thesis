				\item \textit{Notes:} The table presents coefficient estimates from regressions at the school-ethnicity level, only keeping schools within 100 KM of a Spanish language TV contour boundary. The dependent variable are inverse hyperbolic sine transformed counts of the number of students taking the SAT or ACT in Panel A, the number of students enrolled in calculus in Panel B, and the number of Advanced Placement tests passed in Panel C. TV dummy is an indicator variable for a person living in a county with access to Spanish language television based on the FCC regulation OET Bulletin 69, which is interacted with an indicator for whether the demographic is Hispanic (the omitted group are Asians). Columns 1-3 include county level controls for log(income), log(population), and percentage of the county that is Hispanic, as well as school level controls for the number of Hispanic and Asian students enrolled. Columns 2-3 control for the number of teachers and total number of students at the school. Column 3 controls for indicators denoting whether the school contains a primary, middle, and high school division. Standard errors are robust. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 10\%, 5\%, and 1\% levels, respectively.
