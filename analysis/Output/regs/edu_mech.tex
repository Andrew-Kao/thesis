				\item \textit{Notes:} The table presents coefficient estimates from regressions at the school-ethnicity level, only keeping schools within 100 KM of a Spanish language TV contour boundary. The dependent variable are inverse hyperbolic sine transformed counts of students classified as having limited English proficiency in Panel A and the number of students bullied on the basis of their ethnicity or race in Panel B. TV dummy is an indicator variable for a school with access to Spanish language television, which is interacted with an indicator for whether the demographic is Hispanic (the omitted group are Asians). Columns 1-3 control for the number of Hispanic and Asian students enrolled. Columns 2-3 control for the number of teachers and total number of students at the school. Column 3 controls for indicators denoting whether the school contains a primary, middle, and high school division. School district fixed effects are always included. Standard errors are clustered at the school district level. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 10\%, 5\%, and 1\% levels, respectively.
