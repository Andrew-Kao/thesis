				\item \textit{Notes:} The table presents coefficient estimates from regressions at the school level, only keeping schools within 100 KM of a contour boundary. The dependent variables are inverse hyperbolic sine transformed counts of Hispanic students who have received an out of school suspension in the prior year in Panel A, and Hispanic students chronically absent (over 15 days a year) in Panel B. The key independent variable of interest is the TV Dummy, which tracks whether the school is within a coverage contour boundary for a Spanish language television station. This is interacted with the distance to the boundary. County controls include log income, log population, and percentage county Hispanic for the county which the school is located in. School size controls account for the number of teachers and total number of students at the school, while school type controls include dummies for whether the school contains a primary, middle, and high school division. All regressions also control for the number of Hispanic students enrolled at the school. Standard errors are given in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 10\%, 5\%, and 1\% levels, respectively.
