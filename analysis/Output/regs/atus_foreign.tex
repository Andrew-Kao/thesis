				\item \textit{Notes:} The table presents coefficient estimates from regressions at the individual level. Panel A uses the number of minutes of TV watched with parents as the outcome, while Panel B uses the total number of minutes of TTV watched and restricts the sample to those who were born in a foreign country. TV dummy is an indicator variable for a person living in a county with access to Spanish language television, which is interacted with an indicator for whether the individual is Hispanic. Columns 1-4 include individual demographic controls for sex, age, and age squared, as well as the mean log(income) of the county. Columns 2-4 control for the percentage of the county that is Hispanic. Columns 3-4 control for the county's log(population). Column 4 controls for whether the individual is foreign born interacted with a Hispanic dummy. Standard errors are clustered at the county level. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 10\%, 5\%, and 1\% levels, respectively.
